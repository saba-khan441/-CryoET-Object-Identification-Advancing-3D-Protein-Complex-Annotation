CZII - CryoET Object Identification

Advancing 3D Protein Complex Annotation with Deep Learning

Overview

Cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) enables high-resolution 3D reconstructions of cellular structures, providing critical insights into molecular arrangements. However, identifying protein complexes remains a major challenge due to high noise levels, low contrast, and missing wedge artifacts in tomographic data.

This project introduces a YOLO-based deep learning model for detecting and localizing protein complexes in Cryo-ET images. The model leverages synthetic Cryo-ET data in Zarr format, applies advanced preprocessing techniques, and refines detection accuracy using k-d tree spatial structures.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 3D tomograms with corresponding ground truth annotations, designed to facilitate automated protein complex identification. The primary objective is to detect and predict particle centers in tomograms and submit predictions for five scored particle types.

Particle Types & Difficulty Levels

✅ Easy: apo-ferritin, ribosome, virus-like particle

✅ Hard: beta-galactosidase, thyroglobulin

❌ Not scored: beta-amylase (for reference but not included in evaluation)
